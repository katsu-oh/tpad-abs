# Touchpad, absolutely!

This tool enables absolute‑position control of the mouse pointer using a three‑finger slide on a touchpad. When you slide three fingers across the touchpad, the pointer moves to the corresponding absolute position on the screen.

The top‑left corner of the screen maps to the top‑left area of the touchpad. Similarly, the bottom‑right corner of the screen maps to the bottom‑right area of the touchpad.

This makes it easy to reach UI elements located at the edges of the screen—such as the Close button in the top‑left corner or the Start menu at the bottom—without tiring or repetitive pointer movement.

## Usage
Run TpadAbs.exe by double‑clicking it, or via Task Scheduler or other methods. Alternatively, you can run TpadAbs.ahk using AutoHotkey v2.0 (64‑bit).

Before using this tool, configure Windows so that the three‑finger gestures are set to "Do nothing."

To exit the program, end TpadDrag.exe from Task Manager.

## Requirements
- Windows 11 with a Precision Touchpad (Windows 10 64‑bit is also available)
